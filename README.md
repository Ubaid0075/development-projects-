# Development Projects Repository

Welcome to my development projects repository! 🙂

This repository is a collection of various coding projects I have worked on during my journey as a software developer and AI/ML enthusiast. It showcases my learning process, experimentation with different technologies, and passion for building practical applications that solve real-world problems.


## About Me

Hi, I'm Mohd Ubaid, a B.Tech student specializing in AI/ML. I have a strong interest in programming, data structures, and building projects that combine creativity with technology. Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my growth as a developer and share projects that reflect my skills, learning, and dedication.

I believe in continuous learning, problem-solving, and experimenting with new ideas. Each project here represents a step in my journey toward becoming a proficient software engineer and AI/ML practitioner.


## Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple projects, each in its own folder. Every project typically includes:
- The main source code files
- Configuration and environment files (if needed)
- Documentation for setup and usage
- A project-specific README (optional)

The goal is to keep each project organized and easily understandable for anyone exploring my work.
